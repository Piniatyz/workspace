	<p>In this example, the image is taller than the element containing it, and it is floated, so it overflows outside of its contianer:</p>

	<div>
		<img class="img1" src="pexels-photo.jpg" alt="pexels-photo" width="170" height="170">
		dont feel like picking up my phone~~~~~~~ ohh today i dont feel like doing anything i just want to lay in my bed 
	</div>
	<p style="clear:right">Add a clearfix class with overflow: auto; to the containing element, to fix this problem:</p>

	<div class="clearfix">
		<img class="img2" src="pexels-photo.jpg" alt="pexels-photo" width="170" height="170">
	dont feel like picking up my phone~~~~~~~ ohh today i dont feel like doing anything i just want to lay in my bed  </div>
